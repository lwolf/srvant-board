todo:
* calculate RShunt for the INA129
* [x] add RTC chip for RPI
* ETHERNET: 25M crystal or the clock from the CPU
* Do I want to add sdcard to BMC?

USB:
* [x] connect USB pins for OTG: nFault,DRV in usb (removed the power chip)
* [x] Do i need to keep BMC and HOST disconnected? (demux solves this)
* [X] connect USB_DEBUX_SELECT to GPIO on BMC
* [x] Since I don't use usb connector, I need to somehow emulate ID pin on BMC (yes, BMC_HOST_DEMUX_CONTROL)


---------
* [x] add a thermo sensors
* add FAN control ?
* [x] RTC for rpi
* NOR Flash?
* Fuse?
* [x] Drop usb hub
* [x] replace USB port with vertical one
* replace HDMI port with vertical one
* experiment with placement and form factor. is it possible/worth making 1U with 2 side placement
* [x] add RC filter to each bmc-host pin (only 0r for now
* [x] led for bmc power
